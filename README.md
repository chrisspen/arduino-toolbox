Arduino Toolbox
===============

Sample projects for doing various tasks with an Arduino.

These are all meant to be used from the command line with [Arturo](https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo).

Usage
-----

Each project is standalone, and meant to be an example, not necessarily a final product.

To use each, first read the README and wire the Arduino as necessary and plug into your host computer via USB.

Then open a terminal in the folder of the project you want to use and run:

    ./buildall

This will compile, upload and open a serial connection to the Arduino to view debugging output.
